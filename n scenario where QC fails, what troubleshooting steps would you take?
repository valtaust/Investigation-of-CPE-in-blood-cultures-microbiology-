Q. In scenario where QC fails, what troubleshooting steps would you take? 
quality controls are necessary to experiments, it is imperative that both
the positive and negative control is successful. Depending on 
which one fails, I will troubleshoot accordingly. For e.g. , if the 
+ve control fails, the first thing I would look for is whether 
or not I added the sample.

Since human error is a common reason for failure, if there is an internal control 
for all samples including controls, then I would ensure that is detectable. 
Other positives on the run eliminate reagent and machine errors of any sort.
