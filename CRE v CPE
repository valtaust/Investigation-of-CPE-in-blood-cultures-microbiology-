Carbapenemase Producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE)
In Ireland, the terms carbapenemase producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) and carbapenem resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) 
are often used interchangeably by healthcare workers when referring to a family of bacteria that live in the bowel. 
CPE/CRE have developed the ability to become resistant to last-resort powerful antimicrobials known as carbapenems, 
which makes them more challenging to treat if they go on to cause infection.
