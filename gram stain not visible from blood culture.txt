Q what to do if you don't see anything in a blood culture's gram stain?
options are a different stain

e.g.s campylobacter might not take up a stain (campy have spiral shape
and might have motility), or fusobacterium have a cell wall 
that isn't staining.
2) re-incubate the blood culture bottle for slow growers like the 
HACEK bacteriology category.

* Check growth curve if positive.

* option -Sometimes seeing the outline on an acridine orange and 
then going back to the gram stain 
knowing more about shape can help you pick up on certain things.

The Acridine Orange is pretty helpful, often a high number of WBCs can 
trigger a positive reading on the instrument, 
and seeing those PMNs will help put your mind at ease.

Have the option to vortex the bottle and remake slides. Also look at the
background to make sure it's not over decolorized. 
Could be a problem with stain.
Then reanalyze slides. Blood cultures are that important.

End is to reincubate the bottles after streaking agar media. Therefore, if once positive, should alarm again
for a slow growth microbe (antibiotic treatment can slow growth), 
Streptococcus pneumoniae lysed cells. 
Gram negative diplococci in meningitis are the aim to find in a gram stain in meningitis symptoms.
