Enterobacteriaceae species
The enterobacteriaceae (Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Escherichia, Hafnia, Klebsiella, Morganella, Proteus, Serratia)
Colonial Morphology: Can be lactose fermenters (pink colonies -MacConkey) or non lactose fermenters (Colourless colonies – MacConkey). 
Generally Lactose Fermenters - Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Klebsiella, Serratia
Generally Non Lactose Fermenters - Hafnia, Morganella, Proteus sp.
Escherichia coli can be appear as either a lactose fermenter or a non lactose fermenter.
Growth Conditions: Grows in an aerobic and facultative anaerobic environment
Gram Stain: Gram negative rods
UTI Chromogenic agar
E.coli typically appear as pink colonies
Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Citrobacter and Serratia species appear as blue colonies
Proteus species appear as colourless/brownish colonies
UCRT – Carbohydrate Tests
In particular, Indole is used in the identification of P.mirabilis which is indole Negative. Other Proteus species are indole positive.
Vitek GN Identification
Susceptibility Testing is performed on all clinically significant Enterobacteriaceae.  Each is examined for antibiotic resistance. 


* Term MDRO is multidrug resistance organism
